Here is my turn on a ***T440P upgrade and configuration guide***. I know it's 2021 and a device from 2013 might not appeal very sexy, but it is. In the time owning the T440P I bought a Razer Blade 15 (2018) and a Microsoft Surface Pro 7. The Razer Blade had hardware quirks (SSD working unreliably) and some hardware was not well supported under Linux. The Surface Pro I bought as a replacement for the Razer Blade had even with custom kernel no Pen and Camera support. ([Read more on that](https://github.com/linux-surface/linux-surface/wiki/Supported-Devices-and-Features#feature-matrix))

My ideal device would be the upgradeability of the [Framework Notebook](https://frame.work/) as a stylus convertible with a current Zen 3 Ryzen. The cherry on top would be a 120 Hz 1080p Panel, in a case like the ThinkPad L13 Yoga. I am dreaming...

So it's 2021 and I am still on an old T440P I bought used for around 170 €. I am still quite happy, the only bummer is the poor battery life. On a 6-Cell Battery I get around of 2-3 hours of usage.<br><br >
But lets start with the hardware upgrades I did to push the notebook through the years.

## Hardware Upgrades
--------------
I used [this guide](https://octoperf.com/blog/2018/11/07/thinkpad-t440p-buyers-guide/#buying-a-unit) as reference for most of the hardware upgrades.

### Display
Since my Notebook came with the standard 1366x768 TN Panel I upgraded to the ***Innolux N140HCE-EN1 Rev. C2*** for around 75 €. The seller shipped the wrong panel, but after a dispute I got the right one. The new display is a pleasure and would be the #1 recommendation for a single upgrade I would do. The upgrade is very easy and well documented.

### CPU
I switched to the ***i7-4700MQ*** with a TDP of 47 W and max. Clock. of 3,4 GHz. I would have gone for the 4702MQ or the 4712MQ but they were overpriced at the time. To handle the heat dissipation I used [Grizzly Thermal Conductonaut](https://www.thermal-grizzly.com/en/products/26-conductonaut-en). With its thermal conductivity of 73 W/mK it is one of the best, but since it is electrically conductive I used nailpolish to seal the surroundings. On Idle I get around 50-55 °C which is approximately 5 °C less then before switching to liquid metal. Under full load it goes as high as 77-80 °C at a Clockspeed of 3 GHz. I am using unvervolt to reduce some voltages a little. More on that later. In the BIOS there is a hidden option to cap the longtime powerlimit at 37 W. To get around this you need to modify the BIOS. See the configuration part for that.

### WiFi AC
For the WiFi Card I switched to a Killer Wireless-AC 1535 which I a had purchased a while ago for cheap. Since the T440P BIOS comes with a ***WiFi Whitelist*** it must be removed via a BIOS patch. More on that later.

### Small Hardware Upgrades
* I installed 16 GB of used DDR3 SO-DIMM RAM.
* I switched the keyboard since my device came with the wrong layout and no backlighting. I bought the keyboard for around 25 € and sold my old for around 15 €.
* I switched to the T450s touchpad. It was around 15 €. Nothing to comment here.
* Using a SSD/HDD caddy I swapped the DVD Drive for a an old SSD I had lying around. The main drive was already a solid state drive.

### Hardware Recap

The single most important upgrade for me was the display. An IPS Panel with FullHD is gorgeous.

In total I paid around 450 € including shipping. You get somehow attached to a piece of hardware once you start customising
